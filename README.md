WARNING - Need to fill out the email and password variables to login to an gmail account

This program uses the selenium module to login to a google account then path to gmail, open a new email message, type in the recipient, subject, and message, then finally sends the email and closes everything opened.

Being able to send emails from the command line is really cool. Not the most useful program, but it is an automated process which is really cool.

This program doesn't seem as fluid and smooth as other ones and maybe in the future I can make it better.
